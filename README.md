# The-Informant, is what I call my blog app.

# Features:
 A home page which is accessible to anyone and everyone whether logged in or out.
 A signup page and a login page, as usual.
 A page for creating a blog.
 User's dashboard page where you can see your blogs you've created and perform
  operations like editing, deleting and viewing.
 
# Missed out features that I couldn't complete in time.
 A contacts page.

#What I would've loved to add
 -A feature that allows a blog owner (a user) to share his/her account's ownership with a fellow user.
   I could've done that but there wasn't much time and I am just managing my resources (had to do the whole project on my phone).
 - a fully functional contact page with email sending capability.

#How to use:
 Run the app.py file to start a local server. 
 Visit the home page where you can click on the login button which will either take you to the login page or straight to the dashboard, depending on whether you're logged in already or not.
 Visit the dashboard after logging in to start creating content!!.
